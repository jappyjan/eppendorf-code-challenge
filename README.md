# Eppendorf Full Stack Challenge

- Create a backend that:
  - Uses the data in the provided data.json file as seed
  - includes a persistence layer
  - includes an API for communication
  - is able to hand data from the persistence layer up to the API

- Create a frontend that:

  - can visualise data consumed from a suitable API
  - allows editing existing entries
  - is able to add new entries
  - is able to delete existing entries

- Provide the necessary deployment scripts to run the application

- It's up to you what technologies/libraries/frameworks you use. You should be able to justify your decision though.

  - You can use external resources/libraries as you might need/want them

- Don't concentrate on fully completing the task. Rather focus on clean and reasonable application and code structure keeping in mind that a project might need to scale regarding team and application size
- Don't invest more than 6-8 hours on the implementation
- The project should be set up and versioned using a git repository, preferably using Github or similar to give us access to the repository when you are done.
